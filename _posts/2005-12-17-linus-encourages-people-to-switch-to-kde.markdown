    I personally just encourage people to switch to KDE.
    
    This "users are idiots, and are confused by functionality" mentality of
    Gnome is a disease. If you think your users are idiots, only idiots will
    use it. I don't use Gnome, because in striving to be simple, it has long
    since reached the point where it simply doesn't do what I need it to do.
    
    Please, just tell people to use KDE.
    
    Linus
